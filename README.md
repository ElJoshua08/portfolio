# DevbyJoshua — Personal Portfolio

Hey there! I’m **Joshua**, a passionate **Web Developer** who loves crafting interactive, clean, and modern web experiences.
This project is my **personal portfolio**, a space where I showcase my skills, projects, and experiments — basically, the digital home of everything I build.

## About This Project

This portfolio was designed not only to **show what I can do**, but also to **reflect how I think** about design, performance, and user experience.
You’ll find a fully interactive terminal-style interface, animated transitions, and a responsive layout — everything from scratch.

**Tech stack:**

- **Next.js** personal prefence
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ShadCN** for customizable components

## A little bit about me

I’m a **self-taught developer** with a strong curiosity for technology and user experience.
I enjoy turning ideas into working code and bringing interfaces to life with thoughtful details and motion.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably:

- Experimenting with new design concepts
- Learning something new about web performance
- Or just enjoying life :)
